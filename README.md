# Why

1. Unsaved contacts make Phone, Messages, and Facetime a mess, and hard to find your contacts.  
2. Creating contacts for numbers is troublesome.  
3. Profile photos added locally cannot adapt to system appearance.  

# How

## To Use

1. Download the latest verion in Release.  
2. Create a list in Contacts and keep it actived.  
3. Import **whatsincontacts.vcf**.  

## To Update

Unless some known permanent numbers are added to existing WHATSINContacts, there is no need to keep local contacts up-to-date with WHATSINContacts as differences in individual usage habits can lead to differences in the associated numbers.  

# Tips

- Importing is recommended to be done on macOS as iCloud syncing will disable transparent background.  
- The **whatsincontactssimple.vcf** includes no uncertain numbers which are set for users who need customization.  
- Due to VCF multi-language unsupported on Apple devices, you may need to edit names by yourself.  
- Welcome to issues and pull requests if you need new WHATSINContacts or have numbers logged.
