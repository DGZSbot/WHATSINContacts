# Why

1. Unsaved contacts make Phone, Messages and Facetime mess and hard to find your contacts.  
2. Creating contacts for numbers is troublesome.  
3. Profile photos added locally cannot adapt with system appearance.  

# How

## To Use

1. Unzip downloaded code zip.  
2. Import contact.vcf you need to your contact.   

## To Update

Actually, unless some known permanent numbers are added to existing WHATSINContact, there is no need to keep local contact up-to-date with WHATSINContact as differences in individual usage habits can lead to differences in the associated numbers.  

# Tips

- Due to the quantity and uncertainty of SMS gateway numbers, WHATSINContact **AdCaptchas** is set for those numbers including but not limited to advertisements and captchas.  
- Welcome to issues and pull requests if you need new WHATSINContacts or have numbers logged.
