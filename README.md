# Why

1. Unsaved contacts make Phone, Messages and Facetime mess and hard to find your contacts.  
2. Creating contacts for numbers is troublesome.  
3. Profile photos added locally cannot adapt with system appearance.  

# How

## To Use

1. Unzip downloaded code zip.  
2. Import contact.vcf you need to Contacts.   

## To Update

Actually, unless some known permanent numbers are added to existing WHATSINContacts, there is no need to keep local contacts up-to-date with WHATSINContacts as differences in individual usage habits can lead to differences in the associated numbers.  

# Tips

- Due to the quantity and uncertainty of SMS gateway numbers, WHATSINContacts **Anycodes** and **Anyservices** are set for those numbers including but not limited to advertisements and captchas. If you are using a message filter and want keep it working, please do add **Anycodes** only.  
- Those VCF ends with suffix **0** includes no numbers which are set for users who need customization.  
- Welcome to issues and pull requests if you need new WHATSINContacts or have numbers logged.
